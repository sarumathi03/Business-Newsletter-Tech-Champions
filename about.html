          <p>
            Business is the activity of making enhancing your skills in one's living or making money by producing or buying and selling products such as goods and services. 
            Having a business name does not separate the business entity from the owner, which means that the owner of the business is responsible and liable for debts incurred by the business. If the business acquires debts, the creditors can go after the owner's personal possessions. A business structure does not allow for corporate tax rates. 
            The proprietor is personally taxed on all income from the business.
          </p>

          <p>
            Businesses can range from small operations operating in one industry to large operations operating in many industries around the world.
            Many businesses organize themselves around some sort of hierarchy, where positions in a company have established roles and responsibilities.
